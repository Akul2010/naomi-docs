# Profile Setup

We have made a handy script that will walk you though the setup process to generate your personalized profile.yaml
The process is easy to follow so there is no need to document it here!

>Note: Depending on what TTS & STT engines you choose the process will ask you for key information related to said engines that will allow Naomi to interface with them!
