# TTI Configuration

TTI stands for text to intent. It takes the text returned by your speech
recognition engine and figures out what the user is trying to do.

One interesting aspect to text to intent parsers when used with speech
recognition, is that the speech recognition engine is unlikely to provide a
perfect transcript of what you said. Many words sound similar, and when
actually listening to a person talk, your brain makes a lot of assumptions
about what you actually hear from context. This is the job of an intent
parser - to figure out what is being asked based on context and clues.
