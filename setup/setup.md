# Environmental Initialization
## Hardware Configuration
Set up audio system
## Profile Setup

Naomi comes with many "skills" plugins built right in that give it the ability for example to tell time, give the weather, get the news, etc. Some of thess require installation specific parameter settings in order to work. To facilitate the process of populating these parameters, which are stored in the profile.yml file, Naomi has the **--repopulate startup** option. In addition at the very first start up when running an update the repopulate process runs automatically.

The repopulate process requires walking through the options one at a time entering appropriate values or accepting existing values which will be highlighted in white if they exist. For options you are unsure about the default displayed or blank should be accepted by simply pressing return. You can always return the process when you have a specific need to make changes. One nice feature is that it allows you to test the audio input and output.  
In particular the following
### Email

### Music Player Daemon (mpdcontrol)

### WWIS Weather
Actually fairly straightforward to populate. Just enter you country, region and lastly your nearest city.
