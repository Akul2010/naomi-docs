# Naomi Documentation

## Introduction

This repository contains the documentation for Naomi.

The result is available at [https://projectnaomi.com/dev/docs/](https://projectnaomi.com/dev/docs/) and [https://projectnaomi.com/plugins/](https://projectnaomi.com/plugins/).

## How it works

In this repo you can find and improve all *general* documentation contents.

### So I can't improve a plugins documentation here?

Correct, this is done in the original repository of the plugin.
You may want to know how to find the right file in all of those repos?
This is fairly easy:
on most of the documentation pages on https://projectnaomi.com/, 
you will find the following link at the bottom, which will point you directly to the file you want to improve.

When your improvement has been made and merged, we will get the updated documentation automatically through our build mechanism.
This happens mostly once a day. Afterwards your change is included in the next build of the Naomi website.

## Contributing to the Documentation

The documentation is a community effort, so everyone is welcome to suggest changes, add new sections and fix bugs.
This is done exactly the same way as for the code repositories, simply through pull requests against this repo.
When editing a page through the _"Edit this page on GitHub"_ link on the website, you will be given the opportunity to
create a pull request directly from GitHub.
Please read our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and try to follow
them as best as you can before submitting a change for review - but don't worry if you don't understand all of them, we
will help you to get it right.
