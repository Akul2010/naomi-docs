# Synology DiskStation

The [DiskStation by Synology](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm) is a famous NAS server solution for your home, allowing the installation of additional packages.
We are proud to be able to provide an [Naomi Synology package](https://github.com/naomiproject/naomi-syno-spk).

Native Synology support is still in development and coming very soon!
