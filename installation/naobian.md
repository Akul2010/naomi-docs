# Naobian - Hassle-free Naomi Setup

The Raspberry Pi and other small single-board computers are quite famous platforms for Naomi.
However, setting up a fully working Linux system with all recommended packages and Naomi recommendations is a **boring task** taking quite some time and **Linux newcomers** shouldn't worry about these technical details.

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em; font-style: italic;"><q>A vocal assistant enthusiast doesn't have to be a Linux enthusiast!</q></p>

Naobian aims to provide a **self-configuring** Linux system setup specific to the needs of every Naomi user.
To that end, the project provides two things:

* Complete **SD-card images pre-configured with Naomi** and many other Naomi- and Hardware-specific preparations for the Raspberry Pi and the Pine A64
* The Naobian Configuration Tool to set up and configure Naomi and many related things on any Debian/Ubuntu based system

Naobian documentation is still in development and coming very soon!
