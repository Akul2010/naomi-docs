# Naomi on Linux

The following instructions will guide you through the process of setting up Naomi and recommended packages for both .DEB (Ubuntu, Debian etc.) and .RPM (RedHat, CentOS, Fedora etc.) Linux systems.

All instructions can be executed in a terminal or remotely via SSH connection.

Native Linux support is still in development and coming very soon!
